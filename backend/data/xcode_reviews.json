With the old UI I could choose to have the side panels hidden on some window tabs, and shown on other window tabs—that convenience is now gone: either shown or hidden on ALL window tabs. That is not logical, because the navigator belongs to the window tab (the selection within the navigator is tied to the window tab), therefore its visibility should also be determined by the window tab. Furthermore, as someone else reviewed, the UI for the left side panel (the navigators) is hideous; and it is also confusing: the buttons at the top of the left side panel are visually within the side panel, but they stay in place (almost) when the side panel is closed. Even worse, given the visual cues of the views, you’d think that the red close button should close only the side panel, but it closes the entire window.",

Downgrading Xcode isn’t allowed, and older Xcode versions won't even open. The latest Xcode breaks native builds due to C++ standard library issues (std::char_traits<unsigned char> in RCT-Folly). No workarounds work without major hacks, patching, or virtual machines.",

This error does not pin point the line of code that has the error. Please fix. Please fix. Please fix.",

It’s a test of patience to use playground. \n\nSincere request to Apple - Please spend some money on making Xcode team to make this IDE better. If you’re doing that already, please bring in some accountability to that team. As a tenured iOS dev, I feel the IDE hasn’t gotten better at all.",
