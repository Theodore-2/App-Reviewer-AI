When I made a new account I just uploaded photo, a profile picture, made it my first post as well. Made a couple reels, just remixed the first post, and go 1 post at a time. It just has something. It doesn’t have to be perfect.",

Weeks go by everything’s normal then one morning I wake up and it’s suspended  with the message that stated  “my account may be associated with another account that didn’t follow community guidelines”.

Why even allow me to create or log into anything if you’re going to keep banning it for being linked to something you already handled?\n\nAt this point, just be transparent and say you don’t want people to make new accounts after a ban. The way devices and IPs get punished is TERRIBLE. Wrongfully accusing people with no proof, no explanation, no case, and no warning is ridiculous. It’s insane that a system is allowed to permanently wipe out accounts with no human being involved 😬.
